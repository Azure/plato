# Examples

In this folder you can find different samples showing you how to do RL on
AML.

We suggest going through the samples in the following order:

1. ``getting-started-on-aml``: learn how train your first RL agent on AML
   with a Python sim, or ``getting-started-anylogic-sim`` if you have an
   Anylogic sim.
2. ``hyperparameter-tuning-and-monitoring``: learn how to use `mlflow` and `ray.tune` to save model checkpoints and tune hyperparameters.
3. ``deploy-agent`` or ``deploy-on-aml``: learn how to deploy an agent
   locally, with docker, or on AML
