# Examples

In this folder you can find different samples showing you how to do RL on
AML.

We suggest going through the samples in the following order:

1. ``getting-started-on-aml``: learn how train your first RL agent on AML
2. ``hyperparameter-tuning-and-monitoring``: learn how to use `mlflow` and `ray.tune` to save model checkpoints and tune hyperparameters.
3. ``deploy-agent``: learn how to deploy an agent locally or with docker
